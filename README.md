# Lexical-Analysis
Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It takes modified source code from language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences. The lexical analyzer breaks these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments in the source code.

## How to setup my code:
Download the zip file available on canvas.
Locate the folder path and open a command prompt.
Check for the version of g++ compiler.
	Command: g++ --version
 

Provide your input in the input_sourcecode.txt file (please provide the spaces after the tokens)
 
In the command prompt, compile the code.
	Command: g++ proj.cpp -o main
 

After successful compilation, letâ€™s execute the code.
	Command: .\main
 

Please open the output_Jeevika.txt file to view the output.
